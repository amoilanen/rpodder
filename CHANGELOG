- Added a test podcast server to test rpodder against
- Written the first end-to-end test for downloading all the links from a given podcast URL
- Written the first ugly end-to-end slice of rpodder, to be re-factored and covered with more low level tests

- Fixed an issue: the query part of the podcast URL was ignored
- Re-factored the first end-to-end slice of rpodder

TODO:
- Add Rake tasks to launch unit/end-to-end/all tests
- Episodes that were once downloaded are not downloaded again
- It is possible to save podcast episodes under names that are different from the names of the physical files on
the server, for example we would like to use the episode's title

- rpodder can be launched from a command line
- Several podcasts can be downloaded in a sequence
- It is possible to configure where to store downloaded podcast episodes
  -- Relative directory name can be used for configuration and download
- There is a possibility to resume download in case it was interrupted
- Podcast URL can be tracked for featching updates in the future
- It is possible to fetch updates for all the tracked URLs
- List of podcast URLs being currently tracked can be viewed
- We can stop tracking a podcast URL and updates will not be automatically fetched in the future
- Generic information about podcast URLS can be shown before actually downloading them 
(such as the number of episodes, title, last update, etc.)
- It is possible to download just last n episodes from a podcast (useful in case there are hundreds of episodes)
- Viewing information about how many episodes to download there are and how the download is progressing
- Information about all downloaded episodes can be shown
- Information about only new recently downloaded podcast episodes can be shown
- Old podcast episodes can be automatically removed
- Mode of downloading podcasts in a cross-platform manner (not using 'wget', for example)
- Possible optimization: download episodes in several threads?
- Make rpodder work on Windows
